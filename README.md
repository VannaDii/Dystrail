# 🎮 Dystrail

_What if Oregon Trail took a wrong turn and ended up in D.C.?_

**Dystrail** is a SNES-lite parody survival game where you march toward Capitol Hill, dodging tariffs, raw milk stands, brain worms, and the dreaded **National Pants Emergency**.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Loop

1. **Boot & Loading** → asset preloading with progress bar, _Press Any Key to Begin_.
2. **Persona Selection** → choose your character (Journalist, Organizer, Whistleblower, Lobbyist, Staffer, Satirist) with unique stats and abilities.
3. **Outfitting Store** → purchase supplies and gear before departure.
4. **Share Code & Mode** → prefilled seed (e.g., `CL-ORANGE42`), paste a friend/streamer's code to replay their run.
5. **Mode Select** → **Classic** or **The Deep End** (edgier encounters).
6. **Travel System** → manage pace and diet while burning supplies; weather affects progress and breakdown chances.
7. **Camp Management** → rest, resupply, and recover between legs.
8. **Encounters** → multi-choice cards with stat effects (Raw Milk, Tariffs, Brain Worms, 5G towers, etc.).
9. **Executive Orders** → rotating global debuffs affecting gameplay.
10. **Vehicle Breakdowns** → random failures requiring spare parts or repair time.
11. **Border Crossings** → navigate checkpoints with permits, bribes, or alternative routes.
12. **Filibuster Boss** → multi-phase final challenge.
13. **Result Screen** → comprehensive ending analysis with deterministic scoring, detailed statistics breakdown, shareable text generation, and replay functionality via **OT-style keyboard navigation** (1-9/0 keys).

### Adding Encounters

Edit `dystrail-web/static/assets/data/game.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "tariff_whiplash",
  "name": "Tariff Whiplash",
  "desc": "A surprise tariff now applies to... your stuff.",
  "weight": 5,
  "regions": ["RustBelt", "Beltway"],
  "modes": ["classic", "deep_end"],
  "choices": [
    {
      "label": "Pay the tariff",
      "effects": {
        "supplies": -2,
        "credibility": 1,
        "pants": 5,
        "log": "You pay the tariff. It stings."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding Personas

Edit `dystrail-web/static/assets/data/personas.json`:

```json
{
  "my_persona": {
    "name": "My Persona",
    "desc": "A custom character with unique abilities.",
    "score_mult": 1.0,
    "start": { "supplies": 18, "credibility": 6, "sanity": 10, "morale": 5, "allies": 1, "budget": 110 },
    "mods": { "receipt_find_pct": 5 }
  }
}
```

### Internationalization

Add translations to `dystrail-web/i18n/{language}.json` files. Use `en.json` as the reference template.

### Code Style

- Use Rust 2024 edition conventions
- Follow Yew functional component patterns
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript-style prop interfaces

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Workspace Structure:**

- `dystrail-game/` — Platform-agnostic core game engine (Rust library)
- `dystrail-web/` — Web frontend using Yew (WebAssembly)
- `dystrail-tester/` — Automated testing and scenario validation tools
- `Justfile` — canonical dev scripts for fmt/lint/tests/security/build

**Frontend:** Rust + Yew (React-like) → WebAssembly **Deployment:** Static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) **State Management:** Yew hooks (`use_state`, `use_reducer`) + LocalStorage **Routing:** Yew Router for SPA navigation **Styling:** CSS with retro/pixel-art aesthetic **Assets:** Static files served from `dystrail-web/static/` **Data:** JSON configuration files loaded at runtime **I18n:** Runtime language switching with fallback to English

**Core Game Engine (`dystrail-game/`):**

- `src/state.rs` — core game state and turn progression logic
- `src/encounters.rs` — encounter system and selection algorithms
- `src/personas.rs` — character classes and abilities
- `src/vehicle.rs` — vehicle breakdown and maintenance systems
- `src/weather.rs` — weather effects and seasonal changes
- `src/pacing.rs` — pace and diet configuration
- `src/camp.rs` — rest and resupply mechanics
- `src/crossings.rs` — border crossing challenges
- `src/result.rs` — deterministic scoring and ending analysis

**Web Frontend (`dystrail-web/`):**

- `src/lib.rs` — WASM entrypoint; renders `app::App` and bootstraps a11y/i18n
- `src/app/` — app state machine, routing glue, and top-level view composition
- `src/router.rs` & `src/pages/` — typed routes + page modules (boot, persona, outfitting, menu, travel, camp, encounter, boss, result, 404)
- `src/components/` — shared shell components (header, footer, buttons, modal)
- `src/components/ui/` — feature modules (travel panel, pace/diet panel, camp panel, vehicle status, main menu, save drawer, settings dialog, result screen, crossing card, outfitting store, etc.)
- `src/i18n/` — bundle, formatting, locale metadata, rendering helpers
- `src/a11y.rs` — focus management, high-contrast toggle, aria utilities
- `static/` — assets (images, favicon, JSON data)
- `i18n/*.json` — translations for 20 locales
- `tests/` — wasm-bindgen tests (headless browser)
