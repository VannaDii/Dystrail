# Dystrail â€” Press Kit Intro

*What if Oregon Trail took a wrong turn and ended up in DC?*  
**Dystrail** is a SNES-lite parody survival game where you trek toward Capitol Hill, dodging tariffs, brain worms, raw milk, and executive orders â€” all while trying not to trigger a ðŸ’© **National Pants Emergency**.

Each run has a short, meme-ready **Share Code** (e.g., `CL-PANTS42`, `DP-GATOR97`). Copy a streamerâ€™s code and replay their exact chaos. Choose **Classic** or plunge into **The Deep End** for the spiciest encounters, then face the **3-phase Filibuster Boss**.

No installs, no backend â€” just Rust/Yew, WebAssembly, and pixel satire running in your browser.
